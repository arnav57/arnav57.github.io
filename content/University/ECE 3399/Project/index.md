# Resistance Spot Welder

We have chosen to do the Motor Controller/Driver part of the project. The specifications are outlined below:
- DC Motor to provide a controlled force of <= 5 lbs. in the forward direction, With a <1% ripple
- Reverse direction control can be velocity, position or force control.
- Appropriate safety considerations need to be included
	- Over current protection
	- Door switch
- Measure the voltage and current of the motor driving the weld head
	- measure at 20kHz, better if at a higher rate
- Weld head displacement must be < 1cm.
