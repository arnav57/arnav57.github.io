>How strong is electric force? Consider the forces inside a Helium atom's nucleus, with 2 protons using [[Coulombs Force Law|Coulomb's Law]]

---
Here we just care about the magnitude of the repulsive force one proton experiences from within the nucleus. We can calculate the magnitude as shown below

$$
F_{e} = \frac{kQ_{1}Q_{2}}{R^2}
$$
Using $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ as $q^+$, and a typical distance of $10^{-15}$ m. We get the following force
$$
F_{e} = \frac{(9 \cdot 10^9)(10^{-19})^2}{(10^{-15})^2} = 90 \text{ N}
$$
