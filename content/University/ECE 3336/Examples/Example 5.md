We can use the property of [[Superposition|superposition]] here to find the net force. Basically we can find it as

$$
\vec{F_{\text{net}}} = \vec{F_{13}} + \vec{F_{23}}
$$

This is a pretty simple example, finding the force of any two charges can be seen from [[Example 2]], the new thing here is adding them at the end to see the net force $Q_3$ experiences.
