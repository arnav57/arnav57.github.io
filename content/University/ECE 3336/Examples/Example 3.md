>How strong is the repulsion force of a coulomb? Consider the forces inside a some arbitrary charge cloud, having 2 protons 1 meter apart with 1 C of charge each using [[Coulombs Force Law|Coulomb's Law]]

Here we just care about the magnitude of the repulsive force one charge experiences. We can calculate the magnitude as shown below

$$
F_{e} = \frac{kQ_{1}Q_{2}}{R^2}
$$
Using $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ as $1$. We get the following insanely high force
$$
F_{e} = \frac{(9 \cdot 10^9)(1)^2}{1^2} = 9 \cdot 10^9 \text{ N}
$$
