title: Time Constant

---
Usually denoted $\tau$, the time constant is a value used when talking about exponential growth or decay of systems. In other words it is a value that will provide a 1 (or other integer multiples) into the argument of the exponential terms.

The time constant is helpful because it helps us evaluate the step response of a first order system, as the output will rise to 63% of the final value within one time-constant, and 95% of the final value at 3 time-constants.
